      <img class = "img7" src="../assets/Backgrounds/SidePages/Animation History/FMAB-intro.gif">
      <p>
        During World War 2, most countries used animation for propaganda purposes. Japan's Navy hired Mitsuyo Seo
        to create Momotaro: Sacred Sailors. The story is based off of a traditional Japanese folk tail, Momotaro, about
        a magical boy born out of a peach who teams up with a bear, dog, monkey, and pheasant to defeant monsters. The propoganda
        placed Momotaro as a general and the animals as soldiers fighting for Japan. Although meant to be a piece of propganda, Seo
        was inspired by Disney's Fantasia, and created the movie to inspire children and promote peace.
