							<h1>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h1>
							<p>Fullmetal Alchemist originally started as a manga before being turned into 
							two separate animes: Fullmetal Alchemist (2003-2004) and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood 
							(2009-2012). It had also been turned into a live action movie in 2017 by Netflix.
							</p>

							<h1>Art Style</h1>
							<p>Edward Elric has two main styles. He has a very realistic drawing style 
						   with reasonable proportions with the exception of stylized eyes. He has 
						   “anime” eyes meaning they are far larger than realistic eyes, however it 
						   isn’t excessive. In the manga, he is colored in pure black, 
						   pure white, and simple hatching for shadows. In the
						    anime, he has simple base color with one layer of highlight, and 
						   one layer of shadow. A second chibi style also provides comic relief. 
						   </p>
						</div>

							<h1>Art Style (cont.)</h1>
							<p>The chibi art style reduces characters to their most simple recognizable components. It provides 
							moments of relief and humor in often tense or dramatic situations. 
						   </p>

							<h1>Animation Studios</h1>
							<p>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) was co-produced by Bones, a japanese animation 
							studio, and Aniplex, a Sony subsidiary. The production was overseen by Seiji 
							Mizushima, a japanese anime director responsible for many unique movies and 
							shows. Hiromi Arakawa wanted Bones studio to create a different ending 
							from the one she was in the process of illustrating so she helped Bones create 
							unique stories, personalities and plots for the original story.</p>

							<h1>Author</h1>
							<p>Hiromi Arakawa grew up on a rural dairy 
							farm but always wanted to become a manga artist. During her childhood, most 
							stories created by female artists were meant for girls and were incredibly 
							“girly” while Arakawa was rather far more interested in deeper and 
							darker plots that were typically meant for boys and written by almost exclusively 
							male authors. With hard work and determination she created Full Metal Alchemist.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img src="BookletBox/images/VMurugan6.png" alt="" />
							<h1>Company Ownership</h1>
							<p>The series is owned by Square Enix, a manga publishing company. The series 
							has ended so there are no official animations or manga chapters. Enix now 
							markets Fullmetal Alchemist as it is one of their best selling mangas. They 
							have partnered with several other companies to make merchandise and follow up 
							movies for example, Netflix’s adaptation into live action.
							</p>

							<h1>Voice Actor</h1>
						<p>Vic Mignognia is the voice actor for Edward Elric and was present in both the original and 
							Brotherhood editions. He is also known for being in the english dub of Ouran Highschool Host 
							Club. Edward Elric is voiced by Romi Park throughout the Fullmetal Alchemist Franchise (Japanese). She is a
							famous voice actor in lots of animes including Naruto, Attack on Titan, and branching 
							out to western dubs including Kung Fu Panda and Cars.
						</p>

							<h1>Video Games</h1>
						<p>Edward Elric is in 3 specific Fullmetal Alchemist role play video games that were written and 
							initially drawn by Arakawa before Studio Bones finished the animated scenes. Edward Elric also 
							appears in several other video games as a collective character for example in MapleStory and Kingdom of Hearts. </p>
