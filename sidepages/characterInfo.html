						<h1>Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood</h1>
						<p>Fullmetal Alchemist originally started as a manga before being turned into 
							two separate animes: Fullmetal Alchemist (2003-2004) and Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood 
							(2009-2012). It had also been turned into a live action movie in 2017 by Netflix.
						</p>

						<h1>Art Style</h1>
						<p>Edward Elric has two main styles. He has a very realistic drawing style 
						   with reasonable proportions with the exception of stylized eyes. He has 
						   “anime” eyes meaning they are far larger than realistic eyes, however it 
						   isn’t excessive. In the manga, he is colored in pure black, 
						   pure white, and simple hatching for shadows. In the
						    anime, he has simple base color with one layer of highlight, and 
						   one layer of shadow. A second chibi style also provides comic relief. 
						   </p>

						<h1>Annotation Studios</h1>
						<p>Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) was co-produced by Bones, a japanese animation 
							studio, and Aniplex, a Sony subsidiary. The production was overseen by Seiji 
							Mizushima, a japanese anime director responsible for many unique movies and 
							shows. Hiromu Arakawa, the male pen name for Hiromi Arakawa, was the artist 
							illustrating the manga which was still ongoing during the timeframe of the 
							animation production. She wanted Bones studio to create a different ending 
							from the one she was in the process of illustrating so she helped Bones create 
							unique stories, personalities and plots for the original story.</p>

						<h1>Author</h1>
						<p>Hiromi Arakawa grew up on a rural dairy 
							farm but always wanted to become a manga artist. During her childhood, most 
							stories created by female artists were meant for girls and were incredibly 
							“girly” while Arakawa was rather far more interested in deeper and 
							darker plots that were typically meant for boys and written by almost exclusively 
							male authors. With hard work and determination she created Full Metal Alchemist.

						<h1>Timeline</h1>
						<p>The first iteration Fullmetal Alchemist came out in August 2003 and was updated monthly. Fullmetal
							Alchemsit Brotherhood came out in 2009 and was updated weekly until its finale in June 2010 which
							coincided with the ending of the manga series.</p>

						<h1>Different Permuations</h1>
						<p>Fullmetal Alchemist started as a manga by Arakawa, before being turned into 
							Fullmetal Alchemist the animated series which ran at the same time as the manga 
							so it had a different ending. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood was the final version 
							of the story, remaining faithful to the source material.</p>

						<h1>Company Ownership</h1>
						<p>The series is owned by Square Enix, a manga publishing company. The series 
							has ended so there are no official animations or manga chapters. Enix now 
							markets Fullmetal Alchemist as it is one of their best selling mangas. They 
							have partnered with several other companies to make merchandise and follow up 
							movies for example, Netflix’s adaptation into live action.

							japanese production studio that produced the original series. Bones is broken into sub 
							studios, where Fullmetal Alchemist was produced in Studio D and was directed by Yasuhiro
